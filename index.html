      <div class="dosTercios">
        <p>
            Drop the lengthy email threads, out-of-date spreadsheets,
            no-longer-so-sticky notes, and clunky software for managing
            your projects. Trello lets you see everything about your
            project in a single glance.

            This is a Trello board. It’s a list of lists filled with cards, used
            with a team or by yourself.
        </p>

        <img style="box-sizing: border-box;max-width: 100%;padding: 5em 5em 5em;" src="home-hero.png" alt="A Trello Board" class="rounded-corners">

        <p style="color:#FFF;padding-left:25%;padding-right:25%;text-align:left">

           Drag and drop cards between lists to show progress.
           Add as many people as you need and drag them to cards.
           Add and reorder lists as you need. <strong>Trello
            adapts to your project, team, and workflow.</strong>
            <br>
            <br>

           You’ll see everything about your project just by glancing at the
           board, and it all updates in real-time. There’s nothing to set up
           and everyone gets it instantly.
